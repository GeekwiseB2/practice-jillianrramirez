        <h3>I graduated from college in 2014 with a degree an Eglish. I loved writing, but didn't know exactly what I wanted to do post-graduation. While job-hunting, I took a few free online courses in HTML and was intrigued. However, I was convinced my background in the humanities meant I didn't have the chops for a tech job. But after almost a year at a steady office job, I'm ready to take the leap, and prove to myself that I can make a successful, creative, and fulfilling career in the tech industry.</h3>
